<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivation and Problem Statement</head><p>Vishnu Sarukkai (sarukkai@stanford.edu)</p><p>• The datasets acquired provide two forms of data: betting odds data, which informs us of the bets offered by sportsbooks, and game data, which gives us data summarizing NBA games. ○ Betting odds data: Sports Book Review Online offers betting odds for every NBA game since October 2007. ○ Game data: Basketball Reference provides game-by-game team-and player-level data, which we retrieved using Frank Goitia's NBA crawler for every season since 2007-2008.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion:</head><p>• Due to the rapidly changing nature of the NBA it is difficult to acquire sufficient training data that reflects the way the game is currently played.</p><p>• Note that the Collaborative Filtering model, which didn't use any team features, outperformed the Random Forest. ○ This shows the high variance in our data as well as the strong seasonal trends that a model needs to encompass in order to be accurate on this task.</p><p>• We achieved a test Mean Squared Error of 369.84 for our best model.</p><p>• On May 14, the Supreme Court legalized sports betting, paving the way to a new market worth an estimated $150 billion.</p><p>• In this project, we attempt to apply Machine Learning algorithms to predict the outcomes of certain betting indicators in the NBA, such as the Money-Line, the Point Spread, or the Over Under.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Architectures:</head><p>• Trained the Collaborative Filtering model with a hidden size of 10 for 1000 epochs.</p><p>• Trained the Neural Network for 5000 epochs with a learning rate of 10^-6 and weight decay of 1.</p><p>• Trained the LSTM model with a hidden size of 20 with dropout of 0.2 and SGD with learning rate 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Datasets Features</head><p>• For every game in our dataset, we extracted the following information: ○ Statistics for both teams' past three games. This includes simple statistics such as Points Scored or Total Rebounds, but also more complex features like Offensive Rating or Plus/Minus. ○ Season averages for both teams' respective opponents in the past three game in the same categories. ○ Number of days since the last game for both teams. ○ Distance traveled by both teams.</p><p>• More specifically, we focus on estimating the number of points scored by both teams in every NBA.</p><p>• While we were able to closely approximate the number of points scored in a game, our estimates were not precise enough to allow us to "beat the house" on the long run.</p><p>○ Encourages future work to be done on feature selection and engineering; ○ Current best models can beat the house around 51.5% of the time, but successful long-term betting patterns need to be correct at least 52-53% of the time.</p></div>		</body>
