<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature Significance</head><p>• Certain features are constantly predictive of whether a loan is approved or denied • Educational loans are likely to be denied • Credit card consolidation and debt consolidation loans are likely to be approved</p><p>• Hypothesize this relaxation was to prepare for their IPO in 2014</p><p>• These features are significant at = .</p><p>• Put 'credit card consolidation' as the loan purpose to game the system and have better chance of loan getting approved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification</head><p>• Predict if loan application is approved • 98% F-measure in 2015</p><p>• Increasing ability of the model to make better predictions given more data • Hypothesize that the dip in '08-'09 performance is due to limited data and absence of significant attributes </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regression and PCA</head><p>• Predict interest rate and Tackle noise by dimensionality reduction • Notice that there is a noticeable 'kink' in the data after 3 principal components • Loan Grade is highly predictive of interest rate • ( = 3) increases RMSE~25% • RMSE increases steadily over the years</p><p>• Hypothesize that this is due to increasing underlying model complexity</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Visualization</head><p>• Apply clustering to find structure related to Loan Purpose and States • 22 dimensions visualized using T-SNE • Clear clusters in the high dimensional space suggests definite sparse structure where similar loan purpose are found together • Results may be used to generate artificial examples, specially for years with limited data available</p></div>		</body>
