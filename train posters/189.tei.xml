Food χ: Building a Recommendation System for Chinese Dishes 

Yogi Huang, Yiting Ji, Yu Zeng 

{yhua6742, yj022011, zengyu} @stanford.edu 

Objective 

-Obtain user and dish data from the 
web, and provide English translation 
-Build a recommendation system for 
dishes through rating predictions 
-Examine the prediction performance 
of our selected algorithms 
-Focus on Chinese food for 
specialization 

-SVD RMSE 

-Error comparison between 
NMF and SVD 

-SVD performs better 

-Use Jaro-Winkler distance for 
mapping and reduced number of 
unique dishe names to 1,628. 

Ratings 

-User ratings are necessary to 
implement methods such as 
collaborative filtering 
-Rating is defined as 

-Ratings from 5 to 10 is kept for 
simplification 

Conclusions 

-Word2Vec directly gives 
recommendations, but it is 
hard to conceptualize or 
quantify errors 
-SVD model performs the best 
for CF as it has the lowest 
RMSE and highest Recall on 
dev set, and the test set error 
is close to the dev set error, 
which means it does not 
overfit and is fairly robust 

Future Work 

-try other recommendation 
systems (hybrid system, 
item-based CF, memory based 
algorithm, ...) 
-obtain data from other dish 
websites to examine stability 
-create user interface 
-References available upon 
request 

Methods 
Word2Vec -Skip Gram 

-Trains a neural network with a single 
hidden layer to perform, and 
outputs words most relevant to the 
input 
-Minimizes the loss function E in each 
training iteration: 

-Returns a similarity score for each 
output word 

Collaborative Filtering 

-Matrix-factorization (MF)-based 
approaches prove to be highly 
accurate and scalable in addressing 
CF problems 
-Implements non-negative matrix 
factorization (NMF) and singular 
value decomposition (SVD) for 
comparison 
-NMF 
-Utilizes Python library 'Surprise' 
-Uses regularized stochastic 
gradient descent update rule 
-Uses λi = 0.06 and λk = 0.06 

-SVD 
-Minimizes by gradient descent 

-Uses learning rate γ = 0.005 and 
regularization factor λ = 0.02
