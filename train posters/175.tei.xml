• Difficulty finding a suitable performance metric 
• Inexperience and lack of exposure to causal 
inference methods 
• High variance and over-fitting due to limited 
number of data examples 

• Numerically solve the constrained 
optimization problem of optimally allocating a 
state's education budget to maximize 
achievement 
• Data Visualization 

• Attempt to model scholastic achievement 
using both exogenous and unchangeable 
input features 
• Back-out the effects of spending changes on 
performance using Causal Inference

Problem Definition 

Data 

Sources 

• Massachusetts individual school level data 
was from a Kaggle dataset from the Mass. 
Department of Education 
• The zip code level demographic, education, 
and employment data was scraped from 
towncharts.com which aggregates data from 
the Census, American Community Survey, 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Geological 
Survey, Medicare and Medicaid, Common 
Core of Data and more 

Processing 

• Preprocessed features, zero-centered mean 
and normalized variance to one 

Principal Components Analysis 

• Considering only non-exogenous features (e.g. 
demographic data), derive top two principal 
components 
• Challenges
