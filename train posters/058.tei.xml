Summary 
Data Processing 
Adjustments for Unbalanced Data 

Background on NDAs 
Methodology 

Objective: Determine feasibility of using 
machine learning to improve the costly legal 
document drafting process 

Research Conducted: Apply supervised 
learning models to predict initial edits to Non-
Disclosure Agreements ("NDAs") 

Key Results: Classification results are promising 
yet also highlight the challenges from relying on 
unbalanced and sparse data from legal 
document text 

NDAs are a type of private contract that 
determines how the participants can use 
sensitive information

Original Draft 

Edited Draft ("Blackline") 

Original and initial edited drafts 
of each NDA were compared to 
determine what changes were 
made and label the tokens 

• Original tokens ("O"): 87% 
• Inserted tokens ("I"): 7% 
• Deleted tokens ("D"): 6%

Classification Results For Training On All Sentences 

Different modifications to the training data set 
were considered to mitigate the bias towards 
"Original" labels
