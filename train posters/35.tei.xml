					<note>Performance measured using 10-fold cross-validation. Logistic Regression implemented Newton&apos;s Method. All deep-learning models used batch binary cross-entropy as the loss and were implemented through Keras/Theano. • Logistic Regression with the derived features &amp; demographics (baseline) • Neural Networks using ICA and/or Craddock ○ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) only ○ RNN or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) + DenseNet ○ CNN + RNN + DenseNet (Figure 2) • Support Vector Machines (Linear, Polynomial, Sigmoid, RBF kernels) CS229: Machine Learning, Stanford University</note>
