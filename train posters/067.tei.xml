• Potentially~10% of household energy consumption can be saved by Non-
Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM) techniques [1] 
• • Appliance state transition is 
modeled as a Markov Chain 
with a finite set of states 
• Individual appliance power 
load curve as input 
• Difference HMM algorithm 
outputs parameters (A, , ) 
which work as the signature of 
the appliance 
• Each state emission modeled as 
a Gaussian distribution of 
power usage 
• Prior distribution of the states 
( ), transition matrix (A), and 
emission matrix ( 
) are 
produced from the curve 

• Viterbi Algorithm used to determine the most probable sequence 
of states for each appliance 
• Disaggregation based on a "Difference" HMM [2]
