<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of this project is to 1) generate a model for six major U.S. airlines, including United Airlines, Delta, Southwest, that performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews so that the airlines can have fast and concise result on their performances, 2) make recommendations on what are the most important aspect of their services they could improve given customers' complains. In this project, we performed multi-class classification using Naive Bayes, SVM and Neural Network on the Twitter US Airline data set obtained from Kaggle. </p></div>

Having tuning different Kernel function, we found the best test accuracy using linear Kernel, LinearSVC.</p><p>u In sentiment Analysis part, one layer neural network is recommended according to its 74% high accuracy compared with SVM and Naïve Bayes u In negative reason classification, Naïve Bayes is recommended according to its lowest test error, giving 63.2% accuracy. u Customer service issue is the most popular negative reason and Delta is the most competitive airline according to its number of negative reviews and distribution of negative reason. </p></div>
