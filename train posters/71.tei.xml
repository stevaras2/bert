<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals</head><p>• Characterize CA's housing markets with public data • Accurately forecast gentrification in Tracts</p><p>• Understand the drivers of gentrification through feature selection and regularization</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>Data comes from American FactFinder (AFF), a public repository of local-, state-, and national-level Census data collated by the United States Census Bureau. It is at the Census Tract level.</p><p>Census Tracts are hyper-local geographic bounding boxes containing ~4,000 people. They are generally invariant in scope over time.</p><p>AFF releases inter-censal surveys with housing market data such as:</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Features and Responses Discussion</head><p>• Ex-ante balanced-ness of the classes was surprising; suggests gentrification is spatial (some countervailing economic force is ensuring costs don't rise uniformly)</p><p>• Non-parametric estimators (Random Forest, XGBoost) outperformed logit; likely due to near-inability to overfit at no cost of bias </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models and Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models:</head><p>Results:</p><p>• Models trained on difference in feature values from 2010 to 2011, responses calculated from 2012 to 2016</p><p>• Hyperparameters for all models tuned by grid search (random forest: no. trees, split subset size; LASSO: regularization coefficient; XGBoost: learning rate, stump depth, and regularization coefficient)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Responses:</head><p>• Long-term △ in monthly housing costs • Long term △ in income distribution, measured by shift in Hellinger distance of income from start-year to end-year vs. a baseline (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>.
