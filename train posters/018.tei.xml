<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geology's non-stationary issues</head><p>Accurate decision-making in the petroleum industry is highly contingent on building a reliable model that reasonably follows subsurface geological structure. A major challenge:</p><p> Geology -&gt; Highly heterogeneous How can non-stationary prior information be incorporated for effectively predicting geology? </p></div>

To handle nonstationarity, a non-stationary approach is adopted -&gt; multiple filters learn over the grid of a TI.
