<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Recent research has increasingly demonstrated the ubiquity and functional importance of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Characterized by fluctuations through large conformational space, IDPs engage in dynamic protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that have not been well-understood through current structure-based analyses. We build on previous work on IDP PPI prediction solely using sequence information and analyze the performance of various machine learning algorithms. We achieve top performance on a previously published IDP PPI dataset by using new featurization and data augmentation techniques. However, the results are difficult to interpret in terms of concrete protein pair characteristics that are favorable for interactions, and more work still needs to be done towards improved feature considerations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the last two decades, many algorithms have been developed to predict regions of disorder (where there is no stable secondary or tertiary structure) within protein sequences 1,2,3,4 . However, less is known about how these disordered regions interact with other proteins. Such research is important for several reasons: 1) a recent estimate 5 suggests that over a third of human proteins are intrinsically disordered; and 2) these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have widespread roles in cellular processes, such as cell signaling and regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related Work</head><p>Many protein-protein interaction prediction programs have been developed in the past, utilizing various heuristic methods as well as standard machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines and random forest (RF) algorithms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> However, much of the available training data comes from structural interactions, such as those found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> In July 2018, Perovic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> published an analysis of "intrinsically-disordered protein" (IDP)-specific interaction predictors. They found an RF predictor to be the best among the models they tested, including gradient boosting machines, SVMs, and other linear models. They achieved an area-under-thereceiver-operating-curve (AUROC; a plot of true-positive versus false-positive rates at different binary decision thresholds) of 0.745, which at the time was the highest score achieved so far, with other algorithms all scoring below 0.7. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset and Features</head><p>The labeled dataset was borrowed from Perovic et al., consisting of 90253 unique proteinprotein pairs where at least one protein was considered "intrinsically disordered" by the DisProt protein disorder database. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Within this dataset, 19796 (22%) pairs were considered to be interacting (positive) and 70457 (78%) to be non-interacting (negative) based on the highly curated Human Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference (HIPPIE) database. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> (Non-interaction is difficult to validate experimentally, but it is commonly assumed that most proteins do not interact at any significant level. Therefore, for this dataset, non-interaction is defined as a lack of experimentally observed interaction.) This dataset was then filtered for proteins with length greater than 50 amino acids to avoid trivial length-dependent auto-correlative feature descriptors.</p><p>Each protein-protein interaction pair was featurized by concatenating the feature vectors of its constituent proteins. Individual proteins were featurized based on techniques used by Perovic et al. and additional methods available in the protr 14 R package. These features can be broadly classified into length-independent features and length-dependent features. The length-independent features describe compositional distributions, such as included amino acid, dipeptide, and transition frequencies. The length-dependent features describe distribution of amino acid properties along the sequence, including (amphiphilic) pseudo-amino acid composition (PAAC) descriptors and several auto-correlative measures. In total, this yields a 2449-dimensional vector for each protein; thus a single protein-protein pair is represented as a 4898-dimensional vector. Note that the dataset was also readily augmented: since whether two proteins interact should not depend on the order of the proteins, both orderings of concatenation of the individual protein feature vectors were included. Therefore, the fully-featurized augmented dataset was a 176548-samples by 4898-features matrix.</p><p>All data were normalized as z-scores (0 mean, 1 variance) then visualized through PCA plots to understand how well featurization separated the binary-labelled data. To reduce the feature complexity, only the top 446 principal components (corresponding to singular values &gt; 1) were retained. Finally, the dataset was renormalized as z-scores and split 60-20-20 into training, validation, and test sets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The PCA plots ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) did not reveal any clear linear decision boundary. However, since PCA merely looks for high-variance dimensions without specifically attempting to separate the data, there still could be other linear boundaries that would separate the data. Therefore, both linear and nonlinear models were tested. The Python package scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>  . A higher value of C will therefore result in higher accuracy on the training set but with potentially worse generalization performance. In this project, was varied 100-fold between 0.1 and 10.</p><p>The non-linear models tested included random forest (RF) classifiers, Gaussian-(or radial-basis function)-kernel SVMs, and neural networks. RFs are ensemble classifiers that average a large number of (relatively high-variance) decision trees (here, 10-100), each trained over a bootstrapped sample of the original data and a subset of the features (here, the top âˆš features ). Enforcing maximum depth (here, 5-50, or unconstrained) and minimum leaf size (here, 5) constraints further reduces variance. The Gaussian-kernel ( , ) = exp (âˆ’ || âˆ’ || <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> 2 2 ) SVMs were regularized similarly to the linear SVMs. The neural networks were setup with a 100-node hidden layer, ReLU activation, and parametrized by L2-regularization strengths between 0.01 and 0.0001, a constant learning rate, and a batch size of 200.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Interestingly, the linear models consistently demonstrated less variance (overfitting) than the nonlinear models, with the exception of the Gaussian-kernel SVMs, which failed to converge within 50 iterations. (The maximum number of iterations was imposed due to time constraints and the quadratic time complexity of the algorithm used.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Nonetheless, the RF models, which fit the training data very well and demonstrated low bias (but higher variance), performed very well. The model that achieved the highest AUROC score on the validation set was a random forest classifier of 100 trees and a max depth of 50. To analyze how well it likely generalizes to unseen data, the model was re-run on an unseen test set on which it achieved an AUROC score of 0.8268, very similar to its performance on the validation set.</p><p>The results were not surprising, given that the PCA plots failed to show strong evidence of linear decision boundaries, therefore suggesting an advantage for non-linear models. Furthermore, Perovic et al. had recorded their top performance with an RF model as well. However, the AUROC achieved here (0.8268) was higher than that reported in their paper (0.745), which is likely due to data augmentation described previously.</p><p>Unfortunately, interpreting the performance result of the top RF model is difficult. This is in part due to the ensemble nature of the RF model and even more so due to the PCA dimensionality-reduction step prior to training. It is therefore almost impossible to concretely explain what protein pair characteristics are favorable for interactions versus non-interactions.   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Results for all models tested. *Did not converge after 1000 iterations. **Did not converge after 50 iterations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Work</head><p>The moderate prediction accuracies achieved through this project demonstrate large potential for improvement. There are several simple extensions of the current project that deserve more attention. First, more (or all) of the original features could be considered, rather than the dimensionality-reduced set of 446 features along the principal components, which was enforced largely due to time and computational constraints. In addition, more advanced neural networks may also be capable in identifying better nonlinear decision boundaries, and by using more granular software packages (like Tensorflow or PyTorch), it would be possible to output loss gradients with respect to individual features to produce saliency maps, thereby allowing improved feature analysis. Finally, finer hyperparameter tuning would almost certainly yield better predictions on the training and validation sets. Many of the non-linear models demonstrated significant overfitting, which could be curbed through different regularization techniques: stricter (larger) minimum leaf sizes for the Random Forest Classifiers; early-stopping criteria and larger L2-regularization penalties (alpha) for the neural networks.</p><p>Different data sources could also be incorporated. The human proteome consists of over 20,000 proteins. Given that a third of them are predicted to be disordered, and disordered proteins participate in an average of over 100 PPIs each, there are a lot more PPIs that can be studied (and predicted). Proteomes from other species (especially well-studied model species like mice, yeast, and fruit flies) can contribute even more data. Many different databases have been set up to capture data produced by protein-protein interaction experiments and computational analyses. BioGRID, for example, currently contains 353,521 human PPIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , while STRING boasts 1.38 billion PPIs across over 2000 organisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Data quality, however, is still a major concern, especially since studies of PPIs often miss non-structured interactions. However, by filtering for biochemical techniques that are more likely to identify disordered PPIs (such as cross-linking mass spectrometry), more balanced datasets can be curated.</p><p>Finally, new featurization strategies appear to be crucial to improving prediction. Current techniques of featurizing individual proteins and then concatenating their feature vectors as a representation of a potential protein-protein interaction have been unsuccessful in producing visual separation of the binary data. Some possible future considerations include incorporating co-evolution information and energy models. Specifically, some disordered domains are known to stabilize upon interactions with other proteins; 18 such information can be matched with predicted or known protein surface geometries to improve predictions. Even more recently, a paper from September this year explores embeddings of protein complexes derived from PPI networks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Ultimately, improved understanding of disordered PPIs has the potential to elucidate many complexities of gene regulation, signal transduction, and other cellular processes. Such information can be invaluable for therapeutic development and further biomedical research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Comparison of disorder prevalence between transcription factors and control (random) sequences from the human genome.
