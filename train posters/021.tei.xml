<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A cyber enterprise is an elaborate web of applications, software, storage, and networking hardware that can see up to a megabit of network traffic per second. The problem of detecting malicious network packets in such a system can be addressed by modeling a controller of the host and Intrusion Detection System as a Markov Decision Process. To boost the resiliency of this MDP controller, we explore generative probabilistic graphical models of network packets to better characterize attack types.</p></div>
