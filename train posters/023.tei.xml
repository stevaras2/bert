					<note>Image Processing The Expectation-Maximization algorithm can also be used to isolate the jelly. Assuming the image is a bimodal distribution, EM is used to estimate the mean and variance. Every pixel is a 3D data point, and by comparing pixels to both distributions the algorithm eliminates any pixels labeled as &quot;background&quot;. EM on the full color image preserves more features, but is slower.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>K-Means for Feature Generation</head><p>An SVM is trained on the feature vectors generated by the K-Means algorithm using a one-vs-all scheme. Cross-validation is used to ensure that the method will generalize to unseen images. The SVM classifies the orientation correctly for 96% of the training images, and is within 1 bucket for 87% of test images.</p></div>
