<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Every day we convert sensory information into action through the process of decision-making. Here, we investigate the neural correlates of decision-making behavior in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). In particular, we use machine learning techniques to ask whether stimulus color or reach direction are represented in the PMd of a macaque performing a checkerboard discrimination task. Interestingly, we find that while stimulus color is not represented, motor choice is robustly represented 200-300 ms prior to movement onset. To explore whether information regarding movement onset is distributed across the population, implying that a decoder might need information from many neurons to accurately decode motor choice, we use forward feature selection to determine the minimum number of neurons needed to accurately decode motor choice. By comparing the 'minimal population' required at different times prior to movement onset, we investigate whether the neural representation changes during the trial. We find evidence that the neural representation of motor choice evolves over the course of the trial. Understanding when these variables are represented in PMd, and how they correlate to animal behavior, will help us gain valuable insight to the underlying mechanisms of sensory decision-making and motor output. A major goal in systems neuroscience is to understand how the combined activity of various brain regions underly the cognitive processes that result in behavior. To accomplish this, we need to know what types of information are represented in the involved brain regions, and how they give rise to behavior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Task Design. One male rhesus macaque (Monkey T) performed a checkerboard discrimination task ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>). board is shown for 500 ms (checkerboard epoch). One color is over-represented on the checkerboard, and the degree of overrepresentation (coherence) varies randomly from trial to trial. Following the checkerboard epoch, a blank screen is shown for 400-800 ms (blank epoch). This screen is then followed by the presentation of two targets (target epoch). One target is on the left and one is on the right, and the color of the target (red or green) is randomly assigned. The animal must choose the target associated with the over-represented color in the checkerboard. The animal receives a juice reward upon correct target selection, and can make the action as soon as the targets appear. Reaction times (RTs) are defined as the time from target presentation to movement onset. The over-represented color, the degree of over-representation (coherence), and the color of the targets are all randomly selected trial to trial.</p><p>Data collection and pre-processing. Monkey T was trained on the task design described above. Hand position was tracked optically with a reflective bead attached to the monkey's hand, and eye position was monitored optically. Information about the stimulus was saved for each trial, and neural data were recorded from PMd (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>) while he performed the task. Neural units were recorded from either a single electrode or from a linear array of electrodes, and we saved any unit that was responsive during any part of the trial. Units were manually sorted online, and the spike times for each unit were saved and smoothed with a boxcar filter to yield a firing rate over time.</p><p>In our analyses, we want to correlate behavior to neural activity, and we know that the reaction times (behavior) vary greatly across stimulus difficulty. Thus, it is possible that the neural activity underlying the fastest and slowest reaction times may be different. To address this, we divided reaction times into 2 bins (fast and slow) and analyzed their neural activity separately. We included units that had sufficient correct trial counts (100 left and 100 right reach trials to the correct target) for each reaction time bin, resulting in 101 units total. Although units were sometimes recorded during different sessions, the highly stereotyped animal behavior and trial structure allowed us to combine data across sessions. Note that by combining units this way, they will not be dependent, as is the case when neurons are simultaneously recorded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Visualizing neural activity during movement. To connect neural activity to task behavior, we first wanted to visualize the neural activity during the task to gain an intuition for how neural activity was evolving during behavior. Here, we focus on neural activity that occurs during the course of the motor choice (reaching to the left or right target), as previous work has shown that motor choice information is contained in PMd <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, visualizing neural activity during reaching can be somewhat difficult.</p><p>To illustrate this, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2A</ref> shows example firing rates for a left-reach trial and a right-reach trial. In both cases, the data is aligned to movement onset (i.e. the beginning of the reach for the correct target). From simply looking at these trajectories, it is not obvious that one trial is a left reach and the other is a right reach.</p><p>To circumvent this problem and analyze population-level activity during movement, neuroscientists oftentimes plot trial-averaged smoothed firing rates. This tactic is often extended to population activity by averaging across units <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2B</ref>). However, this method fails to distinguish left and right reaches, as the averaged firing rates for both slow and fast reaction times are essentially overlaid. Thus, the common tactic of simple averaging is not enough to determine the degree to which these units represent task information.</p><p>In order to reveal any potential differences in the population-level neural activity during movement without plotting the firing rates for all neurons, we employ a slightly more complex data analysis procedure and decompose neural activity using principal components analysis (PCA). Specifically, given a matrix X = [X slow,r X f ast,r X slow,l X f ast,l ], where X slow,r is an N xt matrix of the average neural firing rates across 100 slow RT, right reach trials for N neurons over t time points (and X f ast,r , X slow,l , X f ast,l defined similarly), we find the set of vectors u (or principal components) that maximize u T (XX T )u. By projecting the data onto the first 3 principal components, we see that the population-level neural activity for left reaches diverges from the neural activity for right reaches, demonstrating that motor choice is indeed encoded in this data. Note that this divergence occurs similarly for both slow and fast RTs, indicating that the neural activity evolves in the same way, but at different timescales, for fast versus slow RTs. Average firing rate across all neurons during the reach (t = 0 refers to movement onset). Dotted lines refer to right reaches. C. PCA performed on the neural activity. Black circles correspond to -300 ms prior to movement onset, while the blue circles correspond to movement onset.</p><p>Decoding movement choice and color percept from neural activity. Now that it is clear that the population-level responses vary with motor choice, we first wanted to investigate whether we could decode motor choice from neural activityand if so -how far in advance of the movement onset classification accuracy was above chance. To explore this, we first divided the time within the trial into 41 time points spanning from -300 ms prior to movement onset to 100 ms after movement onset. Then, for each RT and each time point in the trial, we create a 200 trial x 101 neuron matrix with an associated 200-element vector indicating left/right reaches for each trial. We then used this data to train and test three separate decoders: two discriminative-logistic regression and kernelized SVM using a radial basis function, and one generative -Naive Bayes (NB). For SVM, we used parameters that matched what we used in problem set 2, as this parameter set seemed to do well for our data. In all cases, we performed 10-fold cross-validation, where we trained on 90% of the data, tested on the remaining 10%, and repeated this procedure for all 10 sets of testing data. We used three decoders for several reasons: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, to gather a deeper intuition on which classifiers perform best on this particular dataset, (2) to compare our results with other published results, and (3) to draw robust conclusions about our dataset.</p><p>For all decoders, we were able to decode the choice long before the movement had actually started <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). In the case of slow RTs, we were able to decode motor choice at least 300 ms before movement onset. For fast RTs, we could decode motor choice 150-200 ms before movement onset. This is consistent with trial-averaged data that shows that longer RT-trials have greater sustained activity before movement (and thus should have more information about choice before movement) whereas shorter RT-trials have less sustained activity before movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Importantly, as RT reflects the animal's own internal deliberation process, this difference indicates that the internal deliberation process is reflected in PMd dynamics. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>: A. Accuracy of three classifiers that aim to classify the motor choice from neural activity prior to, during, and after movement onset. B. Accuracy of three classifiers that aim to classify the overrepresented color from neural activity prior to, during, and after stimulus presentation. Bold lines are the mean; shaded area represents the standard error across the 10 folds.</p><p>We noted that while classifier accuracy for short RTs is comparable across the trial for all three classifiers, it appears that NB significantly out-performs logistic regression and kernelized SVM for long RTs. As the neurons are conditionally independent (as they were independently recorded), it is perhaps not surprising that NB slightly outperforms logistic regression (as discussed in class, if the assumptions underlying generative models are true, they can outperform the discriminative models). However, we were slightly surprised that SVM performed so poorly compared to NB. Upon further investigation, we found that the SVM training accuracy was 100% for all time points, indicating that this model is over-fitting prior to movement onset. We hypothesize then that the SVM is learning unimportant features of the data (it also has 180 parameters, while the other models have 101) that give rise to lower testing accuracy.</p><p>Given that PMd encodes the output of the decision making process (motor choice), does it also encode the variables that lead to the decision output? To answer this question, we turned to the checkerboard epoch to search for color-related signals. While it is possible that color-related signals are also present during the target presentation, we wanted to specifically investigate whether percepts that influence the decisionmaking process are encoded in PMd. For our initial analysis, we only considered trials during which highest coherence stimuli were presented. We reason that if a color signal is present in this brain area, it should be most robust when a strong stimulus is presented. We aligned the data to stimulus onset, and divided the time within the trial into 41 time points spanning from -100 ms prior to stimulus onset to 300 ms after stimulus onset. We then used our three classifiers to decode dominant checkerboard color. Interestingly, we found that the decoders could not classify red or green checkerboard trials above chance, suggesting that this color-related signal is not present in PMd during stimulus presentation.</p><p>Taken together, our decoding analyses suggest that while PMd activity reflects the internal deliberation process immediately prior to movement onset, PMd activity does not reflect the stimulus percept needed to make the decision leading to motor output.</p><p>Decoding movement choice prior to movement onset using PCA. As discussed in class, one common method of preprocessing a dataset before running a supervised learning algorithm is to apply PCA to the dataset. This type of preprocessing can carry computational benefits (since the algorithms have fewer features to train on), which can be critical for realtime decoding for brain-machine interfaces. Further, as applying PCA can reduce over-fitting, we investigated whether preprocessing the data by applying PCA could increase our classification accuracy.</p><p>To apply PCA to our dataset, we create a 180 trials x 101 neurons matrix for each set of training data at each time point for each RT. For each matrix of training data, we then find the set of k orthogonal vectors u1, . . . , u k , that maximize u T (XX T )u, where X is the 180 x 101 matrix. We choose k ∈ {5, 10, 101} to explore the dependence of classification accuracy on the number of PCs. After finding the PCs, we then project the training data into this space throughX = U T X, where U = [u1 . . . u k ]. We also project the testing data onto the same principal components, whereXtest = U T Xtest.</p><p>Prior to analyzing classification accuracy, we exploited the low-dimensionality of the projected data to visualize the evolution of neural dynamics over the trial. We projected the matrix of training data created 300 ms or 160 ms before the movement, during the time of movement onset, and 100 ms after movement onset, onto its first two components ( <ref type="figure">Figure  4)</ref>. We color each point according to the reach direction. We can clearly observe the divergence of neural activity based on reach direction as the movement onset approaches. Further, we only observe the emergence of two clusters -for left and right reach -and not four clusters -for left/green, left/red, right/green, right/red -indicating that color information is not strongly encoded in PMd during target selection.</p><p>We then investigated classification accuracy of the kernelized SVM and logistic regression decoders when they have PCA-projected inputs. We did not investigate the classification accuracy of the NB decoder, as the inputs now span a wide range of values and no longer directly map onto the classic NB framework. We found that while decoding accuracy did not change for the logistic regression decoder, decoding accuracy increased for the kernelized SVM decoder ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  5</ref>). Decoding accuracy was similar when inputs were projected onto the first 5, 10, or 101 PCs. We hypothesize that <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>: Projection of neural data onto the first two components (PC1 and PC2) for different time points across the trial for the first data fold. Each point corresponds to a single trial; the color of the point corresponds to the reach direction. Note that the color labels switch because the sign is non-identifiable. Finally, because decoding accuracy with only 5 PCs does just as well, or better, than decoders with un-processed inputs, this result has implications for brain-machine interfaces (BMI). With BMI, hundreds of neurons are recorded simultaneously and decoding algorithms need to run as quickly as possible. Pre-processing the initial inputs with PCA could potentially alleviate some computational time while also improving decoder accuracy.</p><p>Forward feature selection reveals that motor choice can be decoded with very few neurons. We next investigated how distributed, and how robustly, motor choice information is encoded across the neural population. For example, it is possible that only a few neurons strongly encode motor choice, and thus a decoder using only these neurons can accurately predict reach direction. On the other hand, it is possible that all neurons weakly encode motor choice and thus a decoder needs all neurons to accurately predict reach direction. Finally, it is possible that all neurons strongly encode motor choice, and thus a decoder only needs a few neurons, which can be randomly selected, to accurately predict reach direction. To explore which of these possibilities is correct, we used forward feature selection to determine the minimum number of units needed to approach the classification accuracy achieved from a classifier using all neurons. Further, we investigated the minimum number of neurons needed at 200 ms prior to movement onset, and the minimum number of neurons needed at movement onset. This will allow us to simultaneously compare whether the most important neurons change over the course of the trial.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref> shows the decoding accuracy of 101 logistic regression classifiers that use a single neuron's activity to decode (histograms on the left). We note that the single-neuron decoding accuracy is overall higher when decoding at the time of movement onset (bottom left). In addition, we note that there are only a few neurons in each case with very high decoding accuracy, suggesting that motor choice information is strongly represented in a small subpopulation of PMd neurons. Consistent with this observation, it is clear that only a few neurons (3-4) are needed to achieve the same accuracy as the whole population. In fact, decoding accuracy with only 3 neurons at 200 ms surpasses full-population decoding accuracy at 200 ms, indicating that the decoder that uses the entire population exhibits overfitting. This is impressive, although not too surprising. Neurons in motor cortex have been shown to be highly heterogeneous in their responses, changing as a function of time, space, velocity, context, and other factors. It is thus unsurprising that there would be a small, but strong, subset of units that happens to code for the task dimension we are interested in, and perhaps the other units are highly selective for other task dimensions.</p><p>We then compared the ten most informative neurons (ranked according to the forward feature selection algorithm) when decoding 200 ms before movement onset and when decoding at movement onset (comparing the x-axis of the right side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref>). Interestingly, we observe that the ten most informative neurons in each case are completely non-overlapping. This indicates that the neural representation is actually changing over the course of the trial -200 ms prior to movement onset, one small subpopulation of neurons predicts future motor choice, while at the time of motor choice, a separate small subpopulation of neurons encodes the information relating to the movement.</p><p>Investigating the stability of the neural representation of motor choice during the task. The results from the previous section suggest that different populations contribute to encoding motor choice at different times in the trial. We wondered if the contributions from these units were stable during the time leading up to the movement, so we investigated the testing accuracy of a decoder that was trained on neural activity from movement onset (termed Movement Onset Decoder; in grey), applied to neural activity at times throughout the trial <ref type="figure">(Figure 7)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>: Observing how well decoders from specific times perform across other times in the trial. Grey: movement onset decoder; red: pre-movement movement decoder; dark purple/green: optimal decoder (from <ref type="figure">Figure 3A)</ref>. Top row: results for short RT; bottom row: results for long RT.</p><p>One hypothesis is that if neural representations are stable and robust, then the performance of this decoder would do just as well as the decoders we previously identified, when we had a separate decoder for each time point (termed Optimal Decoder; identical to the decoder from <ref type="figure">Figure 3A)</ref>. We found that the accuracy of the Movement Onset Decoder closely matched the accuracy of the Optimal Decoder around the time of movement onset (within about 100 ms of movement onset), but at time points farther from movement, the Movement Onset Decoder performed worse than the Optimal Decoder.</p><p>We next investigated the testing accuracy of a decoder trained on neural data 200 ms prior to movement onset (termed Pre-Movement Decoder; in red) when it was applied to neural activity throughout the trials. Similarly, it performed well around the time that the decoder determined, but performance around other times (such as movement onset) was poorer compared to the Optimal Decoder. Thus, a decoder at a given time point (Movement Onset Decoder or Pre-Movement Decoder) does not generalize to other time points. These findings are consistent with our results from forward feature selection, and demonstrate that the representation of motor choice in these units changes dynamically over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>In this project, we aimed to characterize the neural activity of this subpopulation to gain insight into the role of dorsal premotor cortex during a decision-making reaching task. What types of information does this bran area encode, when does it encode that information, and how stable is this encoding? We found that at the time of movement onset and up to 100 ms following movement onset, the right and left reaches were easily and well decoded with any of the three classifiers we used. We also wanted to know how long before the hand movement began could we decode the motor choice. We found that for short reaction times, we could decode motor choice 200 ms before movement onset, whereas for long reaction times, the accuracy at 300 ms before movement onset was still above chance (50%). The Naive Bayes classifier yielded the best results on long reaction times. On the other hand, when we looked at the stimulus epoch, we could not decode the color of the stimulus. Thus, under this perceptual decision-making task paradigm, motor choices are represented in dorsal premotor cortex but perceptual color information is not. This study extends our basic scientific knowledge of how brain regions may integrate and represent complex variables such as perceptual decisions and action selection.</p><p>We then took a closer look at how motor choices are encoded. Given that data projected onto merely 5 PCs could yield high prediction accuracy, we wondered if there might be a small subpopulation of units that are contributing the bulk of the prediction accuracy. Our results from forward feature selection reveal that only 3-4 units were necessary to achieve performance that was comparable to that of the population. This, combined with the knowledge that 5 PCs are enough to decode from, suggests that the intrinsic complexity to complete this task is quite low dimensional (in our case, it is low-dimensional because there are few neurons) <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. We also found that the best-performing subpopulations are different for pre-movement and movement onset times, indicating that the neural representation of motor choice evolves during the course of the task. Future work involving other task contexts and increasingly complex movements could continue to tease apart which specific aspects of motor choice are represented by PMd neurons.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>A.Firing rates from 10 example units during a left and right reach.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">pre-processing the inputs with PCA re-formats the data in such a way that over-fitting is decreased for kernelized SVM. As the SVM is kernelized with a radial basis function that essentially computes the distance between vectors, it seems that orthogonalizing the inputs allows the SVM to learn more relevant features for the data.</note>
